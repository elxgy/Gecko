## Syntax Highlighting

Gecko supports syntax highlighting for numerous programming languages including:
- Go
- Python
- JavaScript/TypeScript
- C/C++
- Rust
- Java
- HTML/CSS
- Markdown
- JSON/YAML
- And many more...

The editor automatically detects file types based on file extensions and applies appropriate syntax highlighting using the "doom-one" color scheme.

## Architecture

Gecko is built with a modular architecture:

- **`main.go`**: Core application logic and UI rendering
- **`textbuffer.go`**: Text manipulation and cursor management
- **`keybinds.go`**: Keyboard shortcut definitions
- **`minibuffer.go`**: Interactive dialogs and search interface
- **`modelupdate.go`**: Event handling and state updates
- **`syntax.go`**: Syntax highlighting integration

## Roadmap

- [ ] Configuration file support
- [ ] Theme customization
- [ ] Multiple file tabs
- [ ] Split pane editing
- [ ] Plugin system
- [ ] Advanced search and replace
- [ ] Git integration
- [ ] Line wrapping options
- [ ] Bracket matching
- [ ] Auto-completion


## Known Issues

- Clipboard integration requires `xclip` on Linux systems
- Some terminal emulators may not support all key combinations
- Very large files (>10MB) may experience performance issues
